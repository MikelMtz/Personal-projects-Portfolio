# Practical Statistical Hypothesis Testing

This was a project part of the Honours College programme of the University of Groningen, integrated in the deepening modules (Practical Statistical Hypothesis Testing course).

The project consisted in collecting data and performing a statistical hypothesis testing from scratch in groups of 4-5 people. Our group looked at how professors and students were able to discern between human and AI written texts (in 2023).
