This was a project part of the Honours College programme of the University of Groningen, integrated in the deepening modules.

The project consisted in collecting data and performing a statistical hypothesis testing from scratch in groups of 4-5 people. In our case we were interested in looking at how professors and students were able to discern between human and AI written texts.
