# Encryption Protocols Comparison

This was a project part of BSc Physics at the University of Groningen, integrated in the course Physics Laboratory III.

The project consisted on testing the differences between classical and quantum encryption algorithms. The classical RSA encryption, decryption and cracking algorithms were coded my me and tested for various parameters. The resulting encryption, decryption and cracking times were displayed in the final article and compared to the results got in the lab for the BB84 quantum encryption protocol, theoretically completely robust to a eavesdropper.
