# Roughness Effects on Slip Boundary

This was a project part of the Honours College programme of the University of Groningen, integrated as an Advanced Research Project (20 ECTS).

It consisted on analysing large pieces of data from an atomic force microscope. The aim was to analyze the effects of roughness on slip boundaries.
