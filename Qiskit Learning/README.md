# Qiskit Learning

This is a set of notebooks I used to learn Qiskit in the process of getting some IBM badges and the Associate Qiskit Developer Certification.

The folders are ordered following my learning path.

## Contents

 - **0 - Introductory Youtube course** (folder): simple youtube course on the qiskit basics
 - **1 - First principles** (folder): first exploration of Qiskit's and IBM hardware's capabilities
 - **2 - Understanding quantum information and computation** (folder): 
    - **ded**: review and deepening of quantum information basics and advanced concepts. It includes two tutorials on *CHSH Inequality* and *Grover's algorithm*.
 - **3 - Variational Algorithm Deign** (folder): advanced course on how variational algorithms in quantum computing are designed: ansatze and variational forms, cost functions, examples and applications, and instances and extensions.
 - **Personal learning snipets.ipynb**: different personal exercises used in the process of preparing the Associate Qiskit Developer Certification.
