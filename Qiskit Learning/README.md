# Qiskit Learning

This is a set of notebooks I used to learn Qiskit in the process of getting some IBM badges and the Associate Qiskit Developer Certification.

The folders are ordered following my learning path.

## Contents

 - **0 - Introductory Youtube course** (folder): simple youtube course on the qiskit basics
 - **1 - First principles** (folder): first exploration of Qiskit's and IBM hardware's capabilities
 - **2 - Understanding quantum information and computation** (folder): 
    - **Basics of Quantum Information.ipynb**: Review of the single and multiple systems, quantum circuits, teleportation, superdense coding, and CHSH game
    - **Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms.ipynb**: Deutsch's algorithm, Deutsch-Josza algorithm, Bernstein-Vazirani problem, Simon's algorithm. Phase estimation and factoring: phase kickback, two-qubit phase estimation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm
    - **Tutorial - CHSH Inequality.ipynb**: Full implementation of the CHSH inequality, which consisted on mapping the classical problem to a quantum circuit, optimising the problem, executing it, and post-processing the results
    - **Tutorial - Grover's Algorithm.ipynb**: Full implementation of the CHSH inequality, which consisted on mapping the classical problem to a quantum circuit, optimising the problem, executing it, and post-processing the results
 - **3 - Variational Algorithm Deign** (folder): 
    - **Ansatze and Variational forms.ipynb**: Heuristic ansatz (N local circuits and Efficient SU2), and problem specific ansatz (optimisation and quantum machine learning)
    - **Cost Functions.ipynb**: Primitives, cost functions, error supression, optimisation loops
    - **Examples and Applications.ipynb**: Custom Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm, Quantum chemistry
    - **Instances and Extensions.ipynb**: Full implementation of VQE, VQD, and subspace search VQE, which consisted on mapping the classical problem to a quantum circuit, optimising the problem, executing it, and post-processing the results
 - **Personal learning snipets.ipynb**: different personal exercises used in the process of preparing the Associate Qiskit Developer Certification.
