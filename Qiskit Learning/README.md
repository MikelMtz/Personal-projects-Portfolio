# Qiskit Learning

A collection of notebooks documenting my journey in learning quantum computing using Qiskit.

## Contents

- **Introductory Course**: Notebooks from a YouTube course on Qiskit basics.
- **First Principles**: Exploration of fundamental quantum computing concepts.
- **Quantum Information and Computation**: Tutorials on quantum algorithms and information theory.
- **Variational Algorithm Design**: Advanced topics in quantum algorithm design.

Explore the notebooks to follow my learning process and experiments in quantum computing.

This is a set of notebooks I used to learn Qiskit in the process of getting some IBM badges and the Associate Qiskit Developer Certification.

The folders are ordered following my learning path.
